    <h1>RPN</h1>
    <p>
      The <em>Reverse Polish Notation</em> is another way of writing
      mathematical calculations. It was invented by the polish mathematician Jan
      ≈Åukasiewicz in 1924.
    </p>
    <p>
      This notation provides several advantages : RPN calculators are based on
      the use of a stack, the operands are placed on top of the stack, while the
      results <br />
      of the calculations are also returned on top of the stack. Although this
      might be disconcerting at first, one quickly realizes that it helps make
      mathematical expressions <br />
      easier to understand and manipulate.

    <h2>Quick introduction to the RPN app on Upsilon.</h2>
    <p>
      When you want to do a calculation in the RPN app on Upsilon, you must
      start by writing all the numbers that will be involved in your expression
      in order of appearance. Then you press the appropriate operand also in
      order of apparition.
    </p>
    <p>Examples :</p>
    To obtain the result of 245*6598 :<br />
    <ol>
      <li>Write 245 and press OK</li>
      <li>Write 6598 and press OK</li>
      <li>Press once the multiplication button</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To obtain the result of (65*98)/78 :</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Write 65 and press OK</li>
      <li>Write 98 and press OK</li>
      <li>Write 78 and press OK</li>
      <li>Press once the multiplication button</li>
      <li>Press once the division button</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You can change the position of a term in the stack by using the
      parenthesis button, which will move it up or down.

        ><b>Note</b> : throughout the whole Omega history, a bug made the RPN
        app hard to safely use on the calculator, however, thanks to RedGlow,
        dl11 and Overengined, the bug was fixed, and i is now totally safe to
        use the RPN app.</i
